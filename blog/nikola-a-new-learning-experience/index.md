.. description: Why and how I chose Nikola over Pelican and Jekyll.
.. type: text

For the past year or so, I have been using Jekyll to maintain my site on GitHub which was just a simple single page with details about me, my projects, and skills (which I never updated.) So as someone using Python for every menial task, I set out to check out some static site generators in Python. And so, I stumbled upon <!--TEASER_END -->Nikola and Pelican.

# Why Nikola and not Pelican?

Now that I had two options, I started reading up on which was preferred and why people had chosen one over the other. There are numerous sites which state speed and features comparing them so I will not go into that. So when I was searching for both, it was evident that Pelican is popular and widely used than Nikola, and so, obviously Pelican will have better support and documentation. So I tried out Pelican with random posts generated and did the same with Nikola. On a quick glance of the config files, I found that Nikola gives so much control and options as compared to Pelican. In a way I have always preferred using apps or products which are not popular as a personal learning tool such that I could contribute to the development of it too.
